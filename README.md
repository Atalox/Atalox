- 👋 Hi, I’m @Atalox
- 👀 I’m interested in any branch of coding, but I would like to code videogames or web sites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, c# and html (I know, too many languages at the same time).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of project, but since I'm new, I haven't mastered any programming language.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't want you to reach me, thanks.
- 😄 Pronouns: he, him (masculine gender).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't have coding partners and I don't know what to do in programming world (not fun at all).
